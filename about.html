    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Hi. I'm Travis Vocino. Husband and dad of two boys. Builder of tools, prototypes, and systems that reduce chaos. I've been working at Meta since 2014, where I'm currently Director of Product Design. I'm focused on communities, how people find each other, connect around their passions, and keep showing up.</p>
        
        <p>Also an investor in early stage companies, I mostly look for indie games, fintech, and creator tools. Big fan of founders with design taste and a bias toward shipping.</p>
        
        <p>I've shipped products to a lot of people, tanked a lot of raids, and allegedly invented the Zim Devastator cyberware.</p>
        
        <p>San Francisco and London.</p>
