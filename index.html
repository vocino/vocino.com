  Root index.html - automatically renders the latest installment
  
  This page uses the installment layout and includes the latest installment's
  content. The latest installment is determined by finding all numbered
  directories (001, 002, etc.) and selecting the highest number.
  
  To add a new installment, create a new numbered directory (e.g., /002/)
  with an index.html file using layout: installment
