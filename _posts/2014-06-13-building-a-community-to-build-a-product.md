I’ve had several ideas floating around in my head for quite some time. Products to build, services to offer, enterprises to initiate. No matter what I did, I could not nail down exactly what it was I wanted to create though. **I knew a couple things.**

First, I wanted it to involve video games in some way. Second, I wanted it to have a strong community aspect.

> Simple, right? **_Not really._**

Coming up with an idea that fits that simple criteria when you don’t have a solid vision to begin with proved to be exceedingly difficult. So difficult, in fact, that I put this dream project off for over a year. During that time I came up with various smaller ideas that garnered some interest but never really clicked. They had names, they had baby branding projects, they had lean-startup launch pages, but never materialized.

This is often the story of entrepreneurs trying to come up with a _business_ that fits their _passion._ It came start to seem like the old trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

What I didn’t want was to force something that didn’t feel right. I needed that special sauce that leads to great ideas and I knew that _people_ were the source of great ideas. So I started to think:

How can I get a focus group of individuals who are focused on the space I wanted to enter and eager to help me develop great ideas. Not only that, wouldn’t it be great if they cheered me on while executing them?

> Easy, I’ll create a **community**!

I had witnessed the kind of hyper-focused communities that I wanted to create while I, myself as a gamer, looked for like-minded people to experience games with. This pursuit usually led me to places like _reddit_, _Something Awful_, and _Metafilter_.

This is further evidenced by groups outside my core focus like _Designer News_ and _Hacker News_—both of which utilize communities to their advantage in selling product and getting feedback.

### Initial Critical Mass

Something like Facebook has appeal due to other people you know being involved with it. That’s the kind of thing I was looking for when building a critical mass.

I had a feeling that if I could reach that point for my own little community, I might be able to generate the kind of self-action members that _reddit_ and _Metafilter_ display.

In simple terms, by “self-action” I mean members taking it upon themselves to make shit happen and grow the community. You want members that feel passionate about getting involved and taking on responsibilities.

#### Lead in Usability

In my space (video games) I was able to reach a preliminary pool of users by presenting them with a decent infrastructure for _them_ to organize in-game activities. It helps that most guild sites for games absolutely suck. They’re run on zero budget and the owners don’t care very much about the longevity of the brand they’re establishing.

When I introduced our forum, run on the absolutely beautiful [Discourse](http://discourse.org/), gamers who were previously used to phpBB-style sites were blown away. This taught me that simply being ahead in infrastructure can go quite a long way if your space is lacking it.

#### Be a real part of your community

It should come as no surprise that people need community leadership. If you’re not building something for yourself and actively participating in the community, it’s going to fail. I don’t see any way around that, other than maybe hiring some kind of community manager but who wants to do that?

I post on my forum every single day. I reply to people in record time (people even think I’m a bot sometimes). I create content and deliver insight on member posts. Granted, we’re talking about video games here but still. It’s critical that you lead by example when it comes to participating in your own community.

#### It’s all about the sign-up

My marketing goals were simple: get people to sign up. I worried about getting posts and replies later. For now, my primary focus was to get that email address so I would at least have the option to market to them when I had something great for them to contribute to.

As with everything, there’s a falloff rate when talking about communities. Some percentage of visitors will sign up, a smaller percentage will reply, an even smaller percentage will start new threads, and an even smaller percentage will stick around.

The important part is that you’ll have that user signed up for _something_ and you’ll have the ability to market to them in the future. You may ask yourself, “Why not just create a landing page with an email signup?”

Your members shape your idea, that’s why.

### Getting Community Feedback

Once I kicked and clawed my way to about 200 members, I started really driving for feedback on what the community wanted me to create. What features did they want developed? How could I aide in their pursuit of the perfect gaming collective?

> What should I be building?

I started numerous threads asking for suggestions. I offered to build new pieces of the gaming community puzzle when I saw discussion happening around it. At some point, I installed [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) and started really tracking this feedback. I keep everything my members suggest in an Evernote.

All of these items can be executed upon and this is where we really start to realize the true power of community building.

### Different spaces, different faces

My goal was to develop something in the video game space but of course that isn’t everyone. However, I believe this method of community-first products could work for a great many verticals.

For example, if you’re interested in building a tool for car owners to track something-or-other but you have no idea what that really is. If you can’t find enough people to tell you, create the forum (literally and figuratively) to facilitate those ideas funneling to your inbox. Believe me, people want good stuff and they’re willing to tell you about it if you let them speak.

Now, don’t get me wrong, building a community is **hard work**. It takes considerable time, effort, and love. If you’re not committed to this initial stage of what could turn out to be your business you will likely never get off the ground. Further, most communities I see out there are vacant wastelands with tons of posts from the creator and no one else.

Achieving community growth is perhaps a good article for another day.
